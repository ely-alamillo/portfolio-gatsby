            Hi, I'm Ely. Nice to mean you.

            Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 8 years
            ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
            collaborated with talented people to create digital products for
            both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally
            curious, and perpetually improving my chops.
